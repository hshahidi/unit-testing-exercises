Welcome to Unit Testing!
By following these exercises you will build the foundational skills needed to practice and implement
unit testing into your everyday coding projects.

1. MathProblem.py and Test_MathProblem.py
  - Clone the repo into a folder on your local computer through an IDE (i.e. VSCode)
  - Download the PyTest library, make sure you are located within that same folder, locate terminal and `pip install pytest`
  - First open the MathProblem.py to view the functions we will be testing. Then open the Test_MathProblem.py to view the unit tests that test each of the functions and their dependecies in MathProblem.py
  - Run the file: `pytest Test_MathProblem.py` and observe the unit tests that pass and fail. Your terminal will output a descriptive list of the failed unit tests with.
